Graph QL:
It an open-source query language for APIs and a server-side runtime for executing those queries
It allows clients to request exactly the data they need in a single network call.
This helps in preventing underfetching and overfetching which is a common drawback in Rest API.

Benefits:
1.) Effeciency:
Clients can fetch all necessary data in a single request, reducing the number of network round trips and improving performance, especially on mobile networks.
2.) Flexibility:
It allows for adding new fields and types to an API without creating breaking changes or new versions, ensuring backward compatibility.
3.) Strong developer Experiance:
The strongly-typed, self-documenting nature of the schema enables powerful developer tools and integrated development environments (IDEs) like GraphiQL, which provide introspection and auto-completion capabilities.
4.) Data Aggregation:
GraphQL can serve as a unified data layer, aggregating data from multiple disparate sources into a single consistant endpoint.
